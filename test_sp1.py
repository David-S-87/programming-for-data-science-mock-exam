# 1. Create a test file that demonstrates the use of the functions from other modules.
# 2. Ensure this file is easy to execute and does not modify the original test structure.
# 3. Demonstrate how to load the dataset, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate them.
# 4. Ensure exception handling is demonstrated for cases like invalid inputs or missing data.
# 5. Provide clear instructions on how to run the demo (e.g., `python test_sp.py`).
# 6. Include a brief explanation of each step within the test file.
