# 1. Define a simple feedforward neural network class using PyTorch (with at least one hidden layer).
# 2. Load the dataset and split it into training and testing sets.
# 3. Standardize the feature values before feeding them into the neural network.
# 4. Train the neural network on the training data and visualize the loss curve over epochs.
# 5. Add proper exception handling during data loading, model training, and evaluation (e.g., invalid data type, empty dataset).
# 6. Provide meaningful error messages when PyTorch dependencies are missing or installation fails.
