# 1. Refactor the existing code into reusable, modular functions:
#    - A function for loading the dataset.
#    - A function for preprocessing the data (normalization, encoding).
#    - A function for training the model.
#    - A function for evaluating the model.
# 2. Ensure each function has a clear and descriptive docstring.
# 3. Properly structure the imports in this file (avoid loading major external packages in __init__.py).
# 4. Ensure that each function is reusable and easily testable in isolation.
