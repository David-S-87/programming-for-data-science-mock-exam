# 1. Create a function to calculate statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for a dataset.
# 2. Create a function to display these statistics in a user-friendly and well-formatted manner (align numbers, round them).
# 3. Create a function to plot a histogram of the dataset.
# 4. Add proper exception handling for edge cases like empty datasets, invalid data types, or missing values.
# 5. Ensure that if necessary libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib) are not installed, the user is informed with an error message.
# 6. Format the statistical output with proper alignment and rounding.
# 7. Ensure all outputs are displayed clearly (print and plot), without overlapping or cluttered output.
