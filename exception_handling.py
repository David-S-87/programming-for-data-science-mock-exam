# 1. Implement functions that might raise common exceptions (e.g., file not found, division by zero, invalid user input).
# 2. Use try-except blocks to catch and handle these exceptions appropriately.
# 3. Ensure meaningful error messages are printed for each exception.
# 4. Document the functions and describe the potential errors that each might raise.
# 5. Ensure that user input is validated (e.g., ensure integer input for number of clusters in clustering tasks).
